## Documentation
Includes only docstrings from module [http://django-mtr-sync.rtfd.org/](http://django-mtr-sync.rtfd.org/)

## How to use
1. Install packages from git:
   `pip install git+https://github.com/mtrgroup/django-mtr-sync.git#egg=django-mtr-sync --process-dependency-links`
2. Add `mtr.sync` to `INSTALLED_APPS` in your settings file
3. Migrate models `./manage.py migrate`
4. Configure `Celery` or `RQ`
5. Create settings for import or export data at `/admin/mtr_sync/settings/` and run action `Sync data` to start process.

## Features
- Import and export data
- Processor API for supporting other formats
- Uses Celery for background tasks and for processing large volumes of data
- Creates reports about importing and exporting operations
- Auto discovering models for use in package
- Data range settings (start, end cells in table), for example, if you need to import data where there is a header with logo or any other unnecessary information
- Field settings:
  - maps model fields with data fields
  - adds and removes fields (ability to skip fields on import)
  - set start cell of exporting data
  - related models import-export by choosing main model
- Supports: CSV(native python3, unicodecsv python2), XLS (using: xlwt-future, xlrd), XLSX (using: openpyxl optimized writer, reader mode, for fast processing of large volumes of data) and ODS(odfpy)
- Saves import, export settings for the processing of data from various sources and for simplicity
- Integration with standart django admin app
- Custom filters (for querysets)
- Modeltransation language activation
- Inline support
- Value processors (convert values before import or export)
- Shortcuts at admin app
- Multilingual (i18n)
- Template integration with django-grapelli
- Action handler for more flexebility (for example not create model but generate source code for it, prepare data for model)
- Supports: Django 1.7-1.9 Python 2.7, 3.3+

## Working on
- Documentation
- Copy-past model
- Fast export, import in object_list
- Replacer model for minimizing dublication content
- Different source input (url)
- Dashboard without admin
- Adding support of JSON, YAML, XML
- Permission control for import settings using django auth, to minimize human errors. For example, this would allow only the manager to choose the settings template for import and to upload files without configuring
- Export templates for (XLS, XLSX, ODS)
  - upload custom templates
- Periodic import, export for automatic updates
- Video tutorial how to set up package and use it
- Plugins for editors ckeditor and redactor â€” insert file from already exported files
- Insert to columns (inline, stacked) from table, for fast creation of inline objects when you don't need to create sync
